# SQL Injections (aka SQLi)

## What is SQLi?

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into queries sent to a database. This can lead to unauthorized access to data, data manipulation, or even full control over the database. SQL is a standard language for managing data held in relational database management systems (RDBMS), including MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and others.

## Basis to Tackle SQLi Challenges
- The `--` comments out the rest of the query, effectively bypassing the password check and logging the attacker in as any user.
- `UNION` clause allows you to group multiple queries together
